## 🌟 Elna Supermatic Cam Designer

We have built a dedicated **Web App** to let you easily draw, edit, and export your own custom stitches!

**👉 [Open the Elna Cam Designer](https://qbarteczek.github.io/elna-supermatic-cams/tools/cam_designer/)**

Features:
- Draw stitch patterns on a 2D canvas (needle lateral position).
- Generate smooth curves or stepped zig-zag profiles.
- Draw the top icon pictogram (embossed on the disc).
- **Export immediately to JSON and `.scad` formats** ready for 3D printing.

## 🖨️ 3D Models & Printing Guide (Ready to Print)

**You don't need OpenSCAD!** We have pre-rendered all 34 cams into `.stl` format.

**👉 [Browse the `stls/` folder to download or view them in 3D directly on GitHub](stls/)**

### 🌟 Recommended: Universal Bottom Ring / Uniwersalny Pierścień 🌟

Instead of downloading 34 different ring files, we provide a single **[universal_ring.stl](stls/universal_ring.stl)**!

Because all 34 cams share the same base circle radius ($r = 18.55\text{ mm}$), shaft hole, and drive slot, **`universal_ring.stl` fits EVERY single cam (01–34)** perfectly without colliding with the machine's follower lever!

**Pro Tip / Wskazówka:** Print 5 to 10 copies of `universal_ring.stl` in advance and store them in a small box. Whenever you want a new cam disc, simply 3D print `cam_XX_body.stl` and glue one universal ring to its bottom!

### 📖 Step-by-Step Guide / Instrukcja krok po kroku

#### 1️⃣ Printing / Druk 3D
- **Download:** Get `cam_XX_body.stl` for your chosen stitch (e.g., `cam_01_body.stl`) and **[universal_ring.stl](stls/universal_ring.stl)**.
- **Slicer setup:** Place both parts **flat on the print bed**.
- **Supports:** Set supports to **DISABLED (NONE)**.
- **Material:** PETG or PLA (0.10 mm – 0.15 mm layer height for smooth curves).

#### 2️⃣ Assembly & Gluing / Składanie i Sklejanie
- Flip `cam_XX_body` upside down (bottom surface facing up).
- Place 2–3 small drops of **cyanoacrylate glue (Superglue / Kropelka)** into the bottom recess.
- Press **[universal_ring.stl](stls/universal_ring.stl)** flush into the recess and hold for 10 seconds.
- You now have a single, perfectly smooth, factory-accurate cam disc!

#### 3️⃣ Machine Installation / Montaż w maszynie Elna Supermatic
- Open the top cover of your Elna Supermatic machine.
- Hold the assembled cam with the **numbers & stitch diagram facing UP** (glued ring at the bottom).
- Place the cam onto the vertical shaft.
- Rotate slightly until the rectangular transport slot aligns with the metal drive pin on the shaft.
- Press down, close the lid, and you are ready to stitch!

*(Note: If you prefer printing the whole cam in a single piece with supports, `cam_XX.stl` is also provided).*

## 🛠️ Modifying & Rendering

If you want to modify the dimensions or use OpenSCAD manually:
The core parametric logic lives in `models/measured_parametric_single_v1/_elna_measured_common.scad`.

**Command-line rendering:**
You can render all 34 cams in batch by running our rendering script (requires OpenSCAD in the root directory or in your PATH):
```bash
./tools/render_all_stls.sh
```

## 📖 Current Status

See [docs/STATUS.md](docs/STATUS.md) for the full verification status of each cam.

### Grounded / More Reliable Models
These models have the strongest basis:
| Cam | Basis |
|---:|---|
| **03** | uploaded STL/SCAD reference cam (Thingiverse) |
| **13** | known 18-position OpenSCAD profile |
| **16** | known 18-position OpenSCAD profile |
| **20** | known 18-position OpenSCAD profile |
| **33** | known 18-position OpenSCAD profile |

Other cams are included as **candidate profiles**. They use the same measured base, but their outer functional edge still needs verification from real top-down photos or original discs.

## ⚠️ Safety / Testing

> **These are mechanical parts for a sewing machine.**

Before using any printed cam:
1. Inspect dimensions with calipers.
2. Test fit without force.
3. Rotate the machine **by hand** for several cycles.
4. Test slowly at low speed.
5. Only then try normal powered stitching.
